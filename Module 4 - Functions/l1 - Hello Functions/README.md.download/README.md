# Functions - Intro 1: Hello Functions

In this exercise, you'll define a few functions inspired by the introductory exercises from module 1.
In module 1, you wrote programs that received user input and printing information to the user.
In this exercise, you'll define functions that accept arguments and return values.

#### Say Hello

Define a function named `say_hello`.
It should take take 0 arguments.
It should always return `"Hello World"`.

It should take 1 argument for the name of who you are saying hey to.
It should return a message saying hey to the name provided in the argument.

#### Age In 2050

Define a function named `age_in_2050`.
It should take 1 argument for the birthyear.
It should return the age of someone in the year 2050 if they were born in the provided birthyear.

#### Can I Take Your Order?

Define a function named `can_i_take_your_order`.
It should take 3 arguments: number of burgers, number of fries, number of drinks.
It should return the total cost of the order. Burgers cost $4.50. Fries cost $1.50. Drinks cost $1.
