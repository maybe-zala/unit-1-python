# Project One - Explorer

In this project you will create a program that allows the user to "explore" a virtual space. This is essentially a big state machine where the current state is the users location and the transitions are the places where the user can go.

### Rubric

- [ ] Application is implemented inside `main` function that is called inside `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- [ ] User can explore at least 5 different locations
    - [ ] Each location has at least one entrance to another location
- [ ] User can explore the locations
    - [ ] Visiting a location displays some information about it
    - [ ] The user can visit another location with an entrance from the current location
- [ ] The user can quit at any time

### Style Guide

- [ ] Code should be formatted neatly.
- [ ] Variables should have meaningful names that accurately describe what they refer to.
- [ ] No sloppy/unnecessary/commented out code.
- [ ] Functions defined at the top of the file
- [ ] Application is implemented inside `main` function that is called inside `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- [ ] Input is collected with input helper functions.
- [ ] Input helpers use validation functions that don't contain side effects and are tested thoroughly.
- [ ] Any significant pure logic is extracted and tested thoroughly.
- [ ] All functions have type annotations and pass the type checker.
