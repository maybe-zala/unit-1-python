# Basic User Interaction - Benchmark: 💪🏋️It's PAT

**Hi, I am your personal automated trainer; but you can call me PAT. My goal is to make sure all of my clients are the healthiest version of themselves. In order to do my job to the best of my abilities, I need your help to calculate my clients Body Mass Index(BMI).**

## Task

For this benchmark, your task is to collect the client weight in pounds and their height in feet and inches; then convert their weight and height to kilograms and meters respectively. Using that information you will calculate and display the client's BMI.

## Example Output

```console
Welcome, It's PAT your personal automated trainer!

Enter your weight(lbs): 120
Enter your height in inches: 65

Results:
Weight in kilograms: 54.42
Height in meters: 1.65
Your BMI is 20.0
```
