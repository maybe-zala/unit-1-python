## Assignment

Now that weâ€™ve learned how to display text, letâ€™s explore how to capture user responses and build an interactive program
Ms. Valerie Frizzle, an innovative and enthusiastic teacher at Innovative Horizons Academy, is gearing up for the new school year. Known for her creative and interactive teaching methods, Ms. Frizzle is determined to bring her quizzes into the digital age. Her goal is to transition from the traditional pen-and-paper format to an interactive digital quiz that will engage her students.

To achieve this, Ms. Frizzle has enlisted your help. Armed with your newly acquired programming skills, you are tasked with creating a dynamic and interactive quiz that will captivate her students and make learning more exciting.

### Common Misconceptions/Errors to Watch Out For

- The input() function always returns the userâ€™s input as a string. If you need a different type, such as an integer or float, you must explicitly convert it.
- Numeric inputs are handled like strings.
- input() is a blocking call, meaning it will wait until the user provides input before proceeding. This can affect the flow of the program, especially in more complex applications.
- Pressing enter inside the string code creates a new line

### Rubric/Style Guide
