## üìù Assignment

In this exercise, you'll write a Python program that helps users find out who authored a requested book. You are provided a 
dictionary with the book information.

Your program should:
Allow the user to type commands to:
   - View the list of books.
   - Enter the name of a book to see the author.
   - Exit the program.

### User Commands:
- `books`: Show the list of available books.
- `author`: Prompt for a book title, then show the author.
- `quit`: Exit the program.

Use a loop to keep prompting the user until they choose to quit.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconception

- **Incorrect key matching**: Users may type a book title with different capitalization or spelling than what‚Äôs stored in the dictionary.  
  ‚Üí Tip: You can either enforce exact matches or use `.lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

- **Wrong data structure**: Some students mistakenly use a list of tuples or two separate lists instead of a dictionary, which complicates lookup.  
  ‚Üí Tip: A dictionary is the most efficient way to map book titles to authors.

## üé® Style Guide

- [ ] Include **comments** explaining each section of the code.
- [ ] Code should be **formatted neatly** and consistently (indentation, spacing).
- [ ] Variables must have **meaningful names** that accurately describe their contents.
- [ ] Avoid **sloppy**, **unnecessary**, or **commented-out** code.
