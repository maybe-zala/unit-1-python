# Tuple - Intro 2: Hello Tuples


In this exercise, you are going to use a tuple I've provided you to build a small application that lets the user view the name of a given module. For example, the user can ask for module 1, and the program should print "Basic User Interaction." To accomplish this task, you should ask the user for a valid number that identifies a module (1-10) and then print the name of that module.


```
Which module? 7
Module 7 : OOP
```

```
Which module? 4
Module 4 : Functions
```

```
Which module? 0
Invalid module number. Please enter a number between 1 and 10.
```

```
Which module? shforteenteen
Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.
```

M1 - Basic User Interaction
M2 - Control Flow
M3 - Data Structures
M4 - Functions
M5 - File Handling
M6 - Dataclasses
M7 - OOP
M8 - SQL
M9 - Testing
M10 - Libraries

## Rubric
- [ ] User can choose a module by providing a valid module number
- [ ] User sees an error message if they provide an invalid module number

### Style Guide

- [ ] Code should be formatted with the replit auto-formatter.
- [ ] Variables should have meaningful names that accurately describe what they refer to.
- [ ] No sloppy/unnecessary/commented out code.
