# Control Flow - Intro 1: The Moment of Truth

## Objectives

By the end of this assignment you should be able to:

- understand what Boolean values are (True and False) and how they are used in Python programming.
- understand comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to compare values and generate Boolean results.
- use of logical operators (and, or, not) to combine or negate Boolean expressions.

## Assignment

"The Moment of Truth" is an American game show where contestants answer 21 increasingly personal and potentially embarrassing questions truthfully to win cash prizes. In our version, we will replace these personal questions with 21 mathematical questions. Contestants must provide "true" or "false" answers to these questions to win their rewards.

The producers want to ensure that the correct answers are used for the predefined mathematical questions. Your task is to develop a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then performs comparisons between the user-provided number and a predefined value. The program should return "true" or "false" based on whether the userâ€™s input meets the comparison criteria. Also, ensure that your program operates and appears exactly as demonstrated in the examples, and maintains the same sequence of comparisons.

### Example

```console
***************************************
*                                     *
*   Welcome to the Moment of Truth!   *
*                                     *
***************************************

Get ready for an exciting challenge where your decisions matter!
Make the right choices, and you might just find out what truth lies ahead.

Good luck and enjoy the game!

### Common Misconceptions/Errors to Watch Out For

- Booleans vs. Integers: True and False are distinct from 1 and 0, though they are often used similarly in numeric contexts.
- Boolean Expression Results: Ensure expressions are correctly formulated to avoid unexpected results, as they evaluate to True or False.
- == vs. =: Use == for comparison and = for assignment to avoid errors.
- Non-Zero Values: Non-zero values are considered True, but 0 and None are False.
- is vs. ==: Use == for comparing values and is for comparing object identity.
- Empty Containers: Remember that empty strings and lists are considered False.
- Logical Operators Misuse: Use parentheses to clarify logical expressions and ensure correct operator usage.

### Rubric/Style Guide

- [ ] Ask the user to enter a number
- [ ] Display the question
- [ ] True and False should NOT be printed as a string.
- [ ] True and False must be displayed using expressions
- [ ] All test cases are passed.
